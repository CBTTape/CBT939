Dear Sam,
1.     Instructions for PCRE2 Release 10.44
1.1    The installation files are:
1.1.1  ZATLAS1.PCRE2.$INSTALL - I do not use it, but Lionel has
       suggested it
1.1.2  ZATLAS1.PCRE2.ASM.XMI - Assembler library
1.1.3  ZATLAS1.PCRE2.CNTLLIB.XMI - Control library
1.1.4  ZATLAS1.PCRE2.COB.XMI - COBOL sample library
1.1.5  ZATLAS1.PCRE2.JCLLIB.XMI - JCL library that includes the package
       documentation
1.1.6  ZATLAS1.PCRE2.LOADLIB.XMI - Load (run time) library
1.1.7  ZATLAS1.PCRE2.SRCE.XMI - Product siurce library
1.1.8  ZATLAS1.PCRE2.TESTLIB.XMI - Test cases library

1.2 Documentation files, attached -  pcre2doc.zip
      The documentation includes pcre2doc.txt which is the documentation
      in ASCII! Please DO NOT translate that to EBCDIC, the JCLLIB
      includes an accurate EBCDIC copy

Release notes
        The "what's new" covers 10.43 that I had abandoned and 10.44.
The reason that 10.43 was abandoned is that it did not compile under
the standard IBM C compiler.   This was corrected on 10.44.  The reason
given to me does not make any sense to me as it is expressed in Clang
mumbo-jumbo.   You are welcome to read the documentation for that
explanation.

        Personal note:
I created and maintained this port for over 10 years.  I will try to do
the next few releases if I could, but I really wish that somebody else
would take over.   I pledge to provide all my scripts and the logic I
applied when creating this port.
