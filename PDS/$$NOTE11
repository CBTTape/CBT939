Hi Sam

I continue to maintain the PCRE2 library for z/OS (EBCDIC) which
is now on release 10.40.   For technical reasons I skipped the
10.39 version.   The main changes in both 10.39 and 10.40 pertain
to JIT and Unicode, both do not affect the EBCDIC version.
Regardless, I do keep current as you may see.

Please load these files from the CBT installation:

ZATLAS1.C14.MACLIB.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.ASM.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.CNTLLIB.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.COB.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.JCLLIB.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.LOADLIB.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.SRCE.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.TESTLIB.XMI

ZATLAS1.PCRE2.TESTGREP should replace the testgrep.   On next
release I will try to put the tests into better order.

Installer please note that member TESTGREP id in TSO XMIT
format to make it FB-80, but its real DCB attributes are
FB-120.  To use it, you have to RECEIVE it as follows:

  TSO RECEIVE INDS(this.pds(TESTGREP))

  and answer the prompts with DSN(your.chosen.name)
      and/or VOL(volser)

Please load the attached file for the documentation

Please DO NOT translate the attached file to EBCDIC as there is already
a copy in the JCLLIB.
