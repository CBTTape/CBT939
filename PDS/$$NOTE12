Hi Sam,

I hope all is well with you.

PCRE2 for z/OS release 10.42 is ready for distribution.  It
replaces the previous version on FILE939.

Note that there is no release 10.41!  It actually came out, but
was short lived (5 days) because of a major bug that prevented
parts of it from being compiled.

There is not too much change in the library itself, but John and
I did some changes in the Rexx API

1. My library functions, no longer print any message to the
   outside world.  Rather, they optionally provide the caller
   with error string.

2. John's API has an option 'nosay' that would prevent the API
   from printing anything, rather it would provide the caller
   with errors on a stem.

This logical and obvious change (the API being an API) was long
overdue and was initiated by an actual  user that incorporated
the library in his product and rightfully wanted to control the
error messages.

As usual. please take these files from my user and take the
attached zip file (documentation) as is.  Please do not convert
the document (in the zip file) to EBCDIC, there is already an
EBCDIC version in the JCLLIB and you may mention it.
