Hi Sam
The new release is here!
As usual, take these files:

ZATLAS1.PCRE2.ASM.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.CNTLLIB.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.COB.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.JCLLIB.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.LOADLIB.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.SRCE.XMI
ZATLAS1.PCRE2.TESTLIB.XMI
ZATLAS1.C14.MACLIB.XMI

and also add the attached zip file.

Do not try to make the documentation (in the zip file) into EBCDIC!
There is an EBCDIC version in the JCLLIB

The only release note is:
